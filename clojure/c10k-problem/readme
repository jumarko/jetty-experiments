My own testing was done with 
    openjdk version "21-ea" 2023-09-19
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu21+79-CA (build 21-ea+33)
--------------------

To start clojure app 
./run-app.sh 

The API is 
http://localhost:3000/api

To run benchmarks, (you'll need wrk)
./run-benchmark.sh 

During the C10k benchmark, you should see a lot of socket read errors.
